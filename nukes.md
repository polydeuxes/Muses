Response to Nuclear Weapons Do Not Exist - https://www.bitchute.com/video/6lLH1OJGU3f9/

06:00 - Radiation is gone/blew away.

So there's two components to radiation, Contamination and radiation. Contamination is to dog shit what radiation is to the smell of dog shit. There's two different components happening. Like when Chernobyl blew up, it threw tons of contamination into the air, which later caused elevated radiation in other regions. The source of contamination is Fission Products, these are the end results of splitting an atom, two smaller atoms and some left overs. Half-life of U-238 is millions of years, fission products range from micro-seconds to years, depending on who formed. Not understanding how this all works causes different arguments to pop up in the film that don't carry weight (like the guys not wearing protection while transporting lilboy). We can go into the types of radiation (gamma, beta, alpha), but maybe later. 

07:00 - Nuclears are weaker than they were before.

Yes, I agree with this. THere's been a lot of propaganda when it comes to nuclear. I'll swing back to this with the Galen Winsor portion. 

08:00 - has anyone seen an atom? we 'split an atom'

This is why I kept asking about nuclear reactors, this argument is harder to defend if you can say yes on reactors. Is Chicago Pile-1 fake or was it real and the path to reactors was real while the bombs were faked. Having one but not the other makes the analysis more difficult; have to find the origin lie. Because new possibilities occur, like were they fake then but real now?

09:00 - The films suck. Lots of things could go into but that's a time sink and a time sink that I think was designed on purpose. 

How much are real, how much are fake? is all footage fake? majority real? I'm tempted to dig into the material but i dont think it'll bear much fruit for the effort. if the footage is fake but the events are real, it'd be a deadend.

15:00 - Hiroshima looks carpet bombed, looks similar to tokyo. 

One detail that's omitted from the documentary is the height of explosion from the bombs. 1000ft and 1500ft height was used. The towns didnt received a direct impact but the pressure and heat from the explosion, this created a larger effect than directly on the ground. Using a high altitude, fires would be a very large part of the damage and it would have similar effects to fire bombs since most of the damage wouldve been by fire. There's effects that cant be explained by a fire bomb like the buildings knocked sideways or have their roofs caved in from a force up above. 

25:00 - reading through document, points at "may cause nuclear chain reaction" and other phrases that bring doubt to nuclear tech. Again, this is why I ask the reactor vs bomb angle, this argument wouldn't be used. And hurts one who would defend reactors but not bombs. 

34:30 - Talks about making dirty bombs + magnesium to fake the look of a nuclear bomb. To get Fission Production specific radiation, you have to specific events occur, you cant 'bring in' that type of evidence, you gotta make it on the spot. The bombing of hiroshima and nagasaki, if they were using traditional bombs, the weight load limit of the plane is my first thought of concern. 

34:50 - The Jesuits. The narrative says they're 8 blocks away from the blast. Later in the film, it says 4 miles away. At 37:44 - Mentions a hill that helps block a lot of the blast for the Jesuits. At this point, I looked at your reference for the eye witness testimony, it says none of this and implies that they were near the center of the blast. Father Siemes mentions a magnesium flash, so lets say magnesium was used in the blast, how much would they need for a flash to be seen 4 miles away? How was the explosion able to provide an explosive force that destroyed windows, 4 miles away, within seconds of the magnesium blast. There's only so much weight the plane could carry for all this. 

39:52 - "implies cloth will protect you from radiation". Yes, clothing does in fact protect you from some types of radiation, namely, alpha and beta radiation, but not gamma. 

40:10 - Siemes talks about walking into the city and not feeling any ill-effects at all. I would expect this. The worst of the radiation was the gamma radiation with the initial blast, over the next 24 hours, you could be exposed to radiation via fission products, but with these, i wouldnt be concerned about external radiation,i would be concerned with internal radiation; accidently consuming a bit of dust that might have alpha decay and expose your internals. Walking into the blast away immediately after I would expect an increase chance of cancer, but not really expect radation poisoning. After 24 hours, the radiation levels in the area are 1000x less, after a week, 1000x less again.

45:15 - Galen Winsor. I actually got a little annoyed with how he was representing Galen in this video. Galen's discussion is more about the propaganda that they've more nuclear fears much worse than they actually are. A big part of this is energy scarcity, nuclear brings about energy abundance and they want scarcity so they can control us, and thats where much of the propaganda and fear stem from imo.

49:10 - "Plutonium might only be obtainable in trace amounts." Back to reactors, what about reactor-grade plutonium? 

54:00 - Loading up the tnt for a mock explosion. I'd be curious to dig more into these details but it's like the videos, proving or disproving this doesnt lead you to the truth. The Bikini Island documents has a lot of information that might help here. 

1:04:35 - "notice all the objects that withstood zero point" - This goes back to my discussion about the height of when they were supposed to explode. The bomb didnt go off on the ground but in the sky so the evidence in the video does make sense.

1:08:40 - "no effects from radiation on the roads?" So we'd have to look at when the roads reopened, if everything is burning for a few days, the roads mightve been closed the first 48 hours in the center. The documentary also does nothing to cover the post casaulties of the explosion. Lots of people got leukeimia and other types of cancer and died within years.

1:09:10 "wheres the big black scorch mark we saw at trinity site?" differences in explosion height, trinity was barely off the ground and directly hit the earth. we shouldnt expect that from a height of 1k feet.

1:09:45 - "why arent they wearing suits, doesnt the bomb have high radiation?" actually no, the bomb itself is quite inert. Like Galen swallowing the uranium, the scientists dont need to fear the bomb's radiation. it has none until the fission products come into existence. Also, lets say it were highly radioactive, the total weight of the uranium was like 10 pounds and it was packed with TNT that would force the smaller piece into the bigger piece, once it has enough for critical mass, the chain reaction starts and it explodes.

1:14:00 "soviets fake their own tests." you did show me a short clip from their tsar testing, have you ever watched the full footage? 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJhZ3i-HXS0

ok, so that's pretty much it for the documentary. some good stuff, but it lacks a lot too. there is a lot of footage that can be called into question, lot of them did look fake. it's all for propaganda, but is it because it was all fake or they needed it to scare people even more? I'm in the latter camp on that, especially if you watch Galen's stuff.
